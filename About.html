  <h1>About Mac N Eats</h1>

  <p>This project was created by <strong>Grace, Ethan, Maria, Katya, and Deeya</strong> as part of our demo. Mac N-Eats is a sustainable food access platform designed specifically for McMaster students.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Many on-campus food vendors discard perfectly good food that doesn't sell by the end of the day.</li>
    <li>At the same time, numerous McMaster students—especially those relying on OSAP—struggle with food insecurity.</li>
    <li>Mac N-Eats provides discounted, unsold fresh food from campus vendors through a mobile app and website.</li>
    <li>Unlike apps like "Too Good To Go," eligibility is based on student financial need, increasing accessibility.</li>
    <li>Vendors upload surplus food, triggering notifications for eligible students to purchase items at reduced prices.</li>
    <li>Service operates Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, with pickups located inside participating food vendors.</li>
    <li>We promote the service through social media to ensure students in need know where to find support.</li>
  </ul>
